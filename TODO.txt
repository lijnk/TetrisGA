General Functionality
-Add replay best genome
-Add modification of genes
-Add modification of parameters

UI
-Make button art style
-Add data screen about Genome
-Add data screen for modifying nodes/genes
-Make Selector buttons not cut generations off in load screen
-Add scroll events (up and down keys + drag bar)

Graphics
-Draw network topology
-Draw graph data

Engine
-Standardise the v_string
-Log killed genomes due to error
-Log and trap other potential errors that may occur
-Add CLI commands

Performance
-Optimise save/load file (recalculate genes and update innovation number so we don't save data for extinct genes)
-Make headless version not open a window
-Optimise graphics routines (avoid recalling constantly)

Bugs
-Fix the network information not displaying
-Fix small memory leak likely happening between generations
-Fix crash for headless version when exiting
-Fix stagnation issue (possible bug with keeping best species/genomes)

Extra
-Add name for each species (pulls random name from file)
-Explore merge load option
